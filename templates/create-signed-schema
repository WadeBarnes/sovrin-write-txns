# Write an Author signed Schema Transaction to a File
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Writes an author signed schema transaction to a file.
# The resulting file containes a signed schema trasaction that is ready to be signed
# by the identified endorcer and written to the ledger.
#
#   - This is a schema author (issuer) operation.
#
#   - In order to set the protocol version you MUST connect to a pool.
#     If you do not the protocolVersion in the resulting transaction will be set to 1.
#       - Libindy uses a global variable for the protocol version, you can not set it 
#         in the cli without connecting to a pool.
#
#   - A wallet containing the author's DID MUST be attacted and open.
#   - The endorser's DID can be specified in the 'ledger schema' command,
#     however it will NOT be written to the transaction unless the transaction is also
#     signed by the author.  This can all be done in a single command, it does not need
#     to be done multiple steps.
#
# Params:
# walletName:
#   - The name of the wallet to be imported.
#   - Example; myorg_issuer
#
# storageType:
#   - The wallet storage type.
#   - Remote Wallet Example; postgres_storage
#   - Local Wallet Example; default
#
# storageConfig:
#   - The wallet storage configuration.
#   - Remote Wallet Example; '{"url":"192.168.65.3:5435"}'
#   - Local Wallet Example; '{}'
#
# storageCredentials:
#   - The wallet storage credentials.
#   - Remote Wallet Example; '{"account":"DB_USER","password":"DB_PASSWORD","admin_account":"postgres","admin_password":"mysecretpassword"}'
#   - Local Wallet Example; '{}'
# 
# poolName:
#   - The name of the ledger pool to use during the operations.
#   - Nothing is actually written to the pool.  The pool is opened simply to have 
#     the protocolVersion set to the correct value.
#   - Example; sandbox
#
# authorDid:

#   - Example; VePGZfzvcgmT3GTdYgpDiT

#   - Example; corp_num,legal_name,permit_id,permit_type,permit_issued_date,permit_status,effective_date
#
# outputFile:

#   - Example; /tmp/dev_schema_signed.txt
